# Cycle 45.5 — Jawcode Native Scrollback Mouse Contract

## Goal

Restore the jawcode interaction contract for cli-jaw fullscreen mode:

- Default fullscreen mode is terminal-native and copy-friendly.
- Native terminal scrollback and drag selection work without a config change.
- Application mouse reporting is opt-in only via `tui.mouseTracking: true`.
- Opt-in app mouse mode still supports wheel-driven transcript scrolling.

This corrects Cycle 45.4's regression where the default moved toward app-owned mouse wheel handling and away from jawcode's native scrollback/selection behavior.

## Root Cause

The current cli-jaw fullscreen contract is internally inconsistent:

1. `bin/commands/chat.ts` seeds `tuiConfig` with `mouseTracking: true`, so a user with no persisted setting enters fullscreen with app mouse capture enabled.
2. `bin/commands/tui/fullscreen-mode.ts` currently enables mouse reporting when `ctx.tuiConfig['mouseTracking'] === true`; because the chat default is `true`, default fullscreen sends DECSET mouse enable sequences.
3. The same fullscreen input path parses SGR mouse sequences unconditionally. If a leaked/stale `ESC[<...M` sequence is received while default native mode is intended, `handleMouseEvent()` can call `screen.enableMouse()` from wheel/press resume paths and silently re-enter app mouse capture.
4. `tests/unit/tui-fullscreen-source-contract.test.ts` still carries the Cycle 45.4 opt-out expectation (`!== false`) while `tests/unit/tui-copy-friendly-mouse.test.ts` already asserts the desired opt-in-only contract (`=== true`).

Net effect: the launched TUI can request mouse reporting by default, so the terminal gives drag/wheel input to cli-jaw instead of preserving native selection and scrollback behavior.

## Jawcode Comparison

Jawcode's practical contract is terminal-native by default:

- It renders into the normal terminal buffer rather than treating mouse input as mandatory application input.
- Users can drag-select transcript text using the terminal's native selection behavior.
- Terminal scrollback remains a first-class navigation path for committed transcript history.
- Application-level mouse handling is an explicit capability, not a default side effect of entering fullscreen.

cli-jaw already ports the major rendering-side pieces of that model: inline frame rendering, committed transcript rows, scrollback protection, and manual viewport reachability. The remaining mismatch is the input contract: fullscreen currently starts with app mouse capture enabled through default config and can re-enable it from parsed mouse input paths.

## Web Research

- Terminfo.dev documents DECSET 1006 SGR mouse mode as `ESC [ ? 1006 h`, enabled "in addition to a tracking mode like ?1000 or ?1003". It reports mouse events as `ESC [ < button ; col ; row M` for press and `ESC [ < button ; col ; row m` for release. This means `screen.enableMouse()`'s `\x1b[?1000h\x1b[?1006h` is not passive formatting; it explicitly asks the terminal to route mouse events to the app. Source: https://terminfo.dev/modes/decset-1006-sgr-mouse
- Ghostty's `mouse-reporting = false` docs say mouse events are not reported to terminal applications even if requested, allowing the mouse to remain available for selection and terminal UI interactions; `true` allows applications to request and receive mouse reporting. Source: https://ghostty.org/docs/config/reference#mouse-reporting
- Ghostty's `mouse-shift-capture = never` docs say Shift is never sent with the mouse protocol and cannot be overridden by the running program; it reserves Shift for mouse selection even if the app requests capture. Source: https://ghostty.org/docs/config/reference#mouse-shift-capture

These docs support the desired default: cli-jaw should not request `?1000h`/`?1006h` unless the user explicitly opts into app-owned mouse behavior. Terminal-level `mouse-reporting=false` is a user-side escape hatch, not a replacement for cli-jaw's default contract.

## Current Broken Contract

### `bin/commands/chat.ts`

Current default includes app mouse capture:

```ts
let tuiConfig = { pasteCollapseLines: 2, pasteCollapseChars: 160, keymapPreset: 'default', diffStyle: 'summary', themeSeed: 'jaw-default', mouseTracking: true };
```

Because settings merge onto this object, absence of a persisted `tui.mouseTracking` value means `true`.

### `bin/commands/tui/fullscreen-mode.ts`

Current startup is opt-in at the call site but default-on in practice because `chat.ts` supplies `true`:

```ts
if (ctx.tuiConfig['mouseTracking'] === true) screen.enableMouse();
```

Current parsing and press/timer behavior is not fully guarded by the same opt-in condition:

```ts
if (isMouseSequence(incoming)) {
    const parsed = parseSgrMouse(incoming);
    if (parsed) {
        const regions = currentRegions(ctx);
        if (handleMouseEvent(viewport, regions, parsed.event, screen, mouseState)) {
            scheduler.request();
            return;
        }
        return;
    }
}
```

`handleMouseEvent()` can call `screen.enableMouse()` in wheel and press resume paths. In native default mode, parsing a leaked SGR sequence must not call this path at all.

### Tests

`tests/unit/tui-copy-friendly-mouse.test.ts` already encodes the desired contract:

```ts
assert.match(source, /ctx\.tuiConfig\['mouseTracking'\] === true/);
assert.doesNotMatch(source, /mouseTracking.*!== false/);
```

`tests/unit/tui-fullscreen-source-contract.test.ts` is stale and expects default app mouse behavior:

```ts
assert.match(source, /ctx\.tuiConfig\['mouseTracking'\] !== false/);
```

## Exact Patch Targets

1. `bin/commands/chat.ts`
2. `bin/commands/tui/fullscreen-mode.ts`
3. `tests/unit/tui-fullscreen-source-contract.test.ts`
4. `tests/unit/tui-copy-friendly-mouse.test.ts`
5. Existing viewport/frame tests as needed:
   - `tests/unit/tui-screen-lifecycle.test.ts`
   - any existing viewport/manual-scroll test file, or a small focused addition if none covers committed-row reachability

Non-targets:

- Do not change `src/cli/tui/render/viewport.ts` behavior where manual scroll includes all flattened transcript rows.
- Do not weaken `src/cli/tui/render/frame.ts` scrollback protection.
- Do not reintroduce alternate-screen behavior.

## Proposed Code-Level Changes

### 1. `bin/commands/chat.ts` — remove default app mouse capture

Change the default config to omit `mouseTracking` or explicitly default it to `false`.

Preferred minimal diff:

```diff
-let tuiConfig = { pasteCollapseLines: 2, pasteCollapseChars: 160, keymapPreset: 'default', diffStyle: 'summary', themeSeed: 'jaw-default', mouseTracking: true };
+let tuiConfig = { pasteCollapseLines: 2, pasteCollapseChars: 160, keymapPreset: 'default', diffStyle: 'summary', themeSeed: 'jaw-default' };
```

Alternative acceptable diff if type/source tests need a literal default:

```diff
-let tuiConfig = { pasteCollapseLines: 2, pasteCollapseChars: 160, keymapPreset: 'default', diffStyle: 'summary', themeSeed: 'jaw-default', mouseTracking: true };
+let tuiConfig = { pasteCollapseLines: 2, pasteCollapseChars: 160, keymapPreset: 'default', diffStyle: 'summary', themeSeed: 'jaw-default', mouseTracking: false };
```

The omission form is cleaner: it makes `mouseTracking` an explicit user setting instead of a defaulted behavior flag.

### 2. `bin/commands/tui/fullscreen-mode.ts` — centralize the opt-in guard

Add a small local helper so startup, parsing, and resume behavior cannot drift:

```ts
function isMouseTrackingEnabled(ctx: TuiContext): boolean {
    return ctx.tuiConfig['mouseTracking'] === true;
}
```

Use it at startup:

```diff
-if (ctx.tuiConfig['mouseTracking'] === true) screen.enableMouse();
+if (isMouseTrackingEnabled(ctx)) screen.enableMouse();
```

Gate SGR parsing before parsing or handling:

```diff
-if (isMouseSequence(incoming)) {
+if (isMouseTrackingEnabled(ctx) && isMouseSequence(incoming)) {
     const parsed = parseSgrMouse(incoming);
```

This is the important safety property: a leaked `ESC[<64;...M` or `ESC[<0;...M` sequence in default native mode must pass through as ordinary input/noise handling, not as a mouse event that can re-enable app reporting.

### 3. `bin/commands/tui/fullscreen-mode.ts` — keep press/timer behavior only inside opt-in mode

Because parsing is gated, `handleMouseEvent()` only runs when opt-in is active. Strengthen the local contract to make that invariant obvious and harder to regress:

Option A: pass `mouseTrackingEnabled` into `handleMouseEvent()` and return false when disabled:

```diff
 function handleMouseEvent(
     viewport: Viewport,
     regions: Regions,
     ev: { kind: string; row: number },
     screen: Screen,
     mouseState: { resumeTimer: ReturnType<typeof setTimeout> | null },
+    mouseTrackingEnabled: boolean,
 ): boolean {
+    if (!mouseTrackingEnabled) return false;
```

Then call it with the helper result.

Option B: keep the signature small but add a comment at the call site and rely on the gated parser. Option A is safer because it makes direct unit/source checks easier and prevents future call sites from bypassing the guard.

Wheel behavior remains opt-in app mode behavior:

```ts
viewport.scrollBy(ev.kind === 'wheel-up' ? -3 : 3, h);
```

Press behavior remains only opt-in app mode behavior:

```ts
screen.disableMouse();
mouseState.resumeTimer = setTimeout(() => {
    mouseState.resumeTimer = null;
    screen.enableMouse();
}, 2000);
```

Default native mode must not reach either `screen.enableMouse()` resume path.

### 4. `tests/unit/tui-fullscreen-source-contract.test.ts` — align with copy-friendly contract

Replace the stale Cycle 45.4 test:

```diff
-test('fullscreen default mouse tracking enables wheel scroll with opt-out', () => {
-    assert.match(source, /ctx\.tuiConfig\['mouseTracking'\] !== false/);
-    assert.doesNotMatch(source, /screen\.enter\(\);\s*screen\.enableMouse\(\);/);
-});
+test('fullscreen mouse tracking is opt-in for copy-friendly native scrollback', () => {
+    assert.match(source, /ctx\.tuiConfig\['mouseTracking'\] === true/);
+    assert.doesNotMatch(source, /ctx\.tuiConfig\['mouseTracking'\] !== false/);
+    assert.doesNotMatch(source, /screen\.enter\(\);\s*screen\.enableMouse\(\);/);
+});
```

If the helper is added, prefer asserting the helper exists and the parser is gated:

```ts
assert.match(source, /function isMouseTrackingEnabled\(ctx: TuiContext\): boolean/);
assert.match(source, /isMouseTrackingEnabled\(ctx\) && isMouseSequence\(incoming\)/);
```

### 5. `tests/unit/tui-copy-friendly-mouse.test.ts` — strengthen the leaked sequence guard

Keep existing opt-in assertions and add a source-level guard that SGR parsing is behind the same opt-in predicate:

```ts
assert.match(source, /isMouseTrackingEnabled\(ctx\) && isMouseSequence\(incoming\)/);
assert.doesNotMatch(source, /if \(isMouseSequence\(incoming\)\)/);
```

If a runtime harness exists for fullscreen stdin events, add an actual input case:

- Launch fullscreen with no `tui.mouseTracking` setting.
- Feed `\x1b[<64;10;5M` (wheel up) and `\x1b[<0;10;5M` (press).
- Assert output does not contain `\x1b[?1000h` or `\x1b[?1006h` after startup.
- Assert no resume timer later writes `\x1b[?1000h\x1b[?1006h`.

### 6. Tests for opt-in app wheel mode

Add or adjust a focused test that sets `ctx.tuiConfig.mouseTracking = true` and verifies:

- Startup emits `\x1b[?1000h\x1b[?1006h`.
- SGR wheel reports are parsed.
- Wheel up/down call the viewport scroll path:

```ts
viewport.scrollBy(ev.kind === 'wheel-up' ? -3 : 3, h);
```

Source-level coverage is acceptable if the existing fullscreen harness cannot simulate raw stdin without broad work, but a harness test is better.

### 7. Keep `src/cli/tui/render/viewport.ts` manual-scroll committed-row behavior

Do not change:

```ts
private visibleRows(): string[] {
    const flat = this.flattenRows();
    return this.follow ? flat.slice(this.committedRows) : flat;
}
```

This is required because manual scroll (`follow === false`) must expose the full flattened transcript, including committed rows already pushed into native scrollback. If this regresses to always slicing `committedRows`, app/manual scroll cannot reach older transcript rows even when the terminal scrollback has them.

Add or keep a test for up/down committed-row reachability:

- Build a viewport with enough transcript rows to commit some history.
- Mark some rows committed.
- Call `scrollBy(-N, height)` or `pageUp(height)` to leave follow mode.
- Assert `composeRegion()` can show rows from before `committedRows`.
- Return to follow mode and assert tail rendering still slices committed rows.

### 8. Keep/strengthen `src/cli/tui/render/frame.ts` scrollback protection

Do not weaken the existing post-history protection:

```ts
commitLines(...) {
    ...
    this.scrollbackProtected = true;
    this.fullRedrawPending = true;
}

protectScrollback(): void {
    this.scrollbackProtected = true;
}
```

Do not allow protected repaint paths to emit CSI 3J (`\x1b[3J`) after committed history exists. The only acceptable `3J` use is disposable launch/pre-transcript clearing, before transcript rows have been committed/protected.

Keep or strengthen tests equivalent to:

- launch/pre-transcript clear may include `\x1b[2J\x1b[H\x1b[3J` outside multiplexers;
- protected resize/repaint after transcript commit includes visible clear `\x1b[2J\x1b[H` but not `\x1b[3J`;
- multiplexer paths avoid saved scrollback erase.

## Verification Commands

Run after implementation, not during this documentation-only task:

```bash
npx tsx --import ./tests/setup/test-home.ts --experimental-test-module-mocks --test tests/unit/tui-copy-friendly-mouse.test.ts tests/unit/tui-fullscreen-source-contract.test.ts tests/unit/tui-chat-launch-scope.test.ts tests/unit/tui-screen-lifecycle.test.ts
```

If a viewport committed-row test file exists or is added, include it in the focused run:

```bash
npx tsx --import ./tests/setup/test-home.ts --experimental-test-module-mocks --test tests/unit/<viewport-committed-row-test>.test.ts
```

Run typecheck only after source/test changes are complete:

```bash
npm run typecheck
```

Because this patch changes CLI/runtime source (`bin/commands/chat.ts`, `bin/commands/tui/fullscreen-mode.ts`), run the required build gate after focused tests/typecheck:

```bash
npm run build
```

Optional smoke evidence for terminal behavior:

```bash
npm run smoke:tui-fullscreen
```

Manual Ghostty check:

1. Ensure no `tui.mouseTracking` setting is present.
2. Start `jaw chat --fullscreen`.
3. Drag-select visible transcript text; selection should be native terminal selection.
4. Scroll terminal history using native scrollback; committed transcript rows should be reachable.
5. Confirm startup output does not request `?1000h`/`?1006h` in default mode.
6. Set `tui.mouseTracking: true` and confirm app wheel mode works while accepting the selection tradeoff.

## Risks

- **Wheel expectation tradeoff:** Default native mode gives terminal scrollback/selection priority. App-owned wheel scrolling only works when `tui.mouseTracking: true`; this is intentional jawcode parity.
- **Leaked SGR input:** Some terminals or prior app states can leave SGR-looking bytes in stdin. Gating parsing behind `mouseTracking === true` prevents those bytes from re-enabling mouse reporting by default.
- **Settings migration:** Users who relied on Cycle 45.4 default app wheel behavior must opt in with `tui.mouseTracking: true`. No migration should set this globally because that would preserve the broken default.
- **Test drift:** Source-contract tests can become brittle. Prefer one or two source-contract assertions for policy plus focused runtime/harness tests for emitted mouse sequences when practical.
- **Scrollback erase regression:** Any future clear/repaint path that emits `CSI 3J` after `scrollbackProtected` or committed rows exist would break the native scrollback contract. Keep frame tests around protected repaint behavior.

## Acceptance Matrix

| Requirement | Patch/Test Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| Default fullscreen starts native/copy-friendly | `chat.ts` no longer defaults `mouseTracking: true`; startup only calls `screen.enableMouse()` when `mouseTracking === true`. |
| SGR parsing cannot re-enable mouse by default | `fullscreen-mode.ts` gates `isMouseSequence()`/`parseSgrMouse()` and `handleMouseEvent()` behavior behind `isMouseTrackingEnabled(ctx)`. |
| Opt-in app wheel mode still works | With `tui.mouseTracking: true`, startup enables `?1000h` + `?1006h`; wheel events call `viewport.scrollBy(...)`. |
| Tests agree on opt-in policy | `tui-fullscreen-source-contract.test.ts` matches `tui-copy-friendly-mouse.test.ts` and rejects `!== false`. |
| Manual scroll can reach committed rows | `viewport.ts` keeps `follow ? flat.slice(committedRows) : flat`; test covers page/up committed-row reachability. |
| Scrollback is not erased after history commit | `frame.ts` protection remains; tests reject `\x1b[3J` on protected resize/repaint after committed history. |
